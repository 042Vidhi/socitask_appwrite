# Socitask

---


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- You can set up an Appwrite instance locally or use the hosted version.
I used the hosted version.
 Get started with Appwrite [here](https://appwrite.io/docs/getting-started-for-web).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/042Vidhi/socitask_appwrite.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   cd socitask
   npm install
   ```


3. **Start the Development Server:** Run the development server using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React app, and you can access it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Build and Deploy:** When you're ready to deploy your app, build it using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory. You can then deploy this build to your preferred hosting provider.
